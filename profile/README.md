# We transform operational chaos into business excellence through custom technology solutions.

As a Denver-based consulting firm, we specialize in building enterprise-grade business management platforms for manufacturing, service, and retail companies drowning in spreadsheets and manual processes.

Our approach is different: we don't just implement existing software—we own and continuously develop the Thaumaturge platform, a modular microservice architecture that adapts to your exact business needs. This means when you need a feature that doesn't exist, we build it. When integration requirements change, we modify the platform. When your business grows, the technology scales with you.

We serve mid-market companies that have outgrown basic tools but don't need enterprise software complexity. Our solutions typically include inventory management, purchase order workflows, sales order processing, and seamless integrations with QuickBooks and other business systems.

Founded by three engineers who understand both technology and business operations, we deliver implementations in weeks rather than months, with ongoing support that treats your success as our success. Every client engagement strengthens our platform capabilities, creating better outcomes for all partners.

Technical excellence drives everything we do. We build with modern, maintainable technologies (C#/.NET, Vue.js, PostgreSQL) that integrate well with existing business systems.

Our clients don't just get software—they get a technology partner committed to their long-term operational success.
